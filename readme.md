# PaperStack

## Introduction

PaperStack is a pioneering platform that aims to revolutionize the conversion of old multi-lingual on-paper datasets into digital formats. Leveraging the power of the FVM and a robust data DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), PaperStack provides an efficient solution for organizations dealing with vast amounts of on-paper open data.

## Problem

The challenge lies in the abundance of historical data stored in handwritten formats on paper. This untapped resource has immense potential for applications such as data training, research, analytics, and more. However, the transition from paper to digital format is often hindered by the sheer volume of data and the associated costs.

## Solution

PaperStack offers a compelling solution by allowing organizations with substantial on-paper open data to enlist the help of contributors. These contributors, motivated by PST native tokens, will receive compensation for their efforts in digitizing the data. This not only facilitates the conversion of historical data but also contributes to reducing paper waste and preventing long-term data loss.


## PST DAO

To ensure the sustainable development and governance of PaperStack, the platform introduces the PST DAO. Token holders are granted the right to vote on proposals within the platform. This innovative approach helps manage the demand and supply of PST tokens effectively. The DAO creator must spend/burn tokens to create proposals, fostering a self-sustaining ecosystem.


## PaperStack Token (PST) - Tokenomics

### Overview

PaperStack Token (PST) is the native utility token of the PaperStack platform, designed to facilitate and incentivize the digitization of on-paper data. The following tokenomics outline the key features, mechanisms, and economic principles governing the PST ecosystem.

### Token Supply

- **Initial Supply:** 1,000,000 PST
- **Growth Mechanism:** Exponential growth annually
- **Purpose:** Reflects the expanding ecosystem and demand for PaperStack services

### Token Demand

- **Growth:** Exponential, tied to the overall platform expansion
- **Influencing Factors:** Increased data digitization activities, partnerships, and diverse use cases

### Token Price

- **Determination:** Supply-demand mechanism
- **Dynamic Pricing:** Adjusted based on exponential growth in both supply and demand
- **Objective:** Ensures the token price aligns with the economic dynamics of the PaperStack ecosystem

### Token Burning

- **Mechanism:** 2% of new annual supply burned
- **Purpose:** Introduces deflationary aspects, reducing overall supply and potentially appreciating token value

### Token Staking

- **Opportunity:** Users can stake PST for benefits within the PaperStack ecosystem
- **Effect:** Staked tokens are considered out of circulation, reducing available supply and potentially increasing scarcity

### Token Buyback

- **Frequency:** Periodic (e.g., every three years)
- **Amount:** 0.5% of circulating supply bought back
- **Objective:** Injects value back into the ecosystem, rewarding token holders

### Utility within PaperStack Ecosystem

- **Use Cases:** Payment for digitization services, access to exclusive datasets, participation in PST DAO
- **Integration:** Native utility token, essential for seamless interaction within the platform

### Governance

- **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO):** PST holders participate in governance
- **Decision-Making:** Voting rights on proposals related to platform upgrades, dataset management, and governance

### Long-Term Sustainability

- **Strategies:** Token burning, staking, and buyback mechanisms
- **Objective:** Create scarcity, foster demand, and ensure long-term growth and investor appeal
