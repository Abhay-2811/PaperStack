# PaperStack

## Introduction

Platform to convert old multi-lingual on-paper data sets to digital format leveraging data-dao on FVM.

## Problem

A large stack of open data from the past is usually available in handwritten format on paper. This data if digitalized can be revolutionizing for use cases such as data training, research, analytics, and many more.

## Solution

Using Paper Stack organizations with large amounts of on-paper open data can pay a small fee to contributors to digitalize it. This also prevents long-term data looses and reduces paper waste.
